# wav-helper
Powershell script that uses FFmpeg to remove metadata from wav files. Useful for solving compatibility issues when playing .wav files on certain CDJs. .wav files downloaded from bandcamp can contain metadata headers which can cause format errors when playing on a CDj. The script can also convert wav files to FLAC, AIFF, MP3-320.
